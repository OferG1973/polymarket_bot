  "description": "This is the market on the relative change (%) of the USD prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the month of November 2021.\n\nTo resolve the market, Coingecko's daily prices will be used. The change of prices will be calculated by dividing the closing price of 30 November 2021 by the opening price of 1 November 2021, ie:\n\n\u0394B =  [$BTC closing price on November 30] /  [$BTC opening price price on November 1]\n\n\u0394E =  [$ETH closing price on November 30]  / [$ETH opening price on November 1]\n \nIf, after the resolution time (December 1st, 2021, 12:00 PM ET), \u0394B is greater than \u0394E, this market will resolve to \"Bitcoin\".\n\nIf, after the resolution time (December 1st, 2021, 12:00 PM ET), \u0394E is greater than \u0394B, this market will resolve to \"Ethereum\".\n\nIf they are exactly equal then the market will resolve 50/50.\n\n----------------------\nTo resolve the market, Coingecko's historical daily prices will be used and can be seen under \"Historical Data\" tab on the following sites:\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/historical_data/usd#panel\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum/historical_data/usd#panel )\n\nThis market will resolve on the November 30 Close price, which will be the same to December 1 Open price. \n\nNote also, that the daily open price refers to 30-min candlestick open price at 12 AM in the UTC+0 Time Zone and is also used in the \"1y\" line chart view.\n----------------------\n\nThe opening prices for November 1st were:\nBitcoin: $61,471.87\nEthereum: $4,292.04",
